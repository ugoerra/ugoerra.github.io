I am an Associate Professor at the [University of Basilicata](https://www.unibas.it), Italy, at the [Department of Engineering](https://ingegneria.unibas.it/site/home.html). I am also the founder of eXtended Reality & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where I lead a research group dedicated to advancing the frontiers of XR and AI technologies. 

I got my Laurea in Informatica cum laude in 2001 from the [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it) and my PhD in Computer Science from the same University in 2004.

Research Summary
======
My research focuses on the intersection of Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Centered Computing, and Visualization. I am passionate about advancing Computer Graphics to create more immersive and realistic visual experiences. By integrating Artificial Intelligence, I develop intelligent systems that can understand, interpret, and generate complex visual data. My emphasis on Human-Centered Computing ensures that the technologies and applications I create are designed with the user's needs and experiences at the forefront. Through innovative Visualization techniques, I strive to make complex information more accessible and understandable, empowering users across various fields to make informed decisions.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively collaborate with industry partners to apply cutting-edge research to real-world challenges. This dual engagement allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, driving innovation in academia and industry.
