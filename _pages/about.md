I am an Associate Professor at the [University of Basilicata](https://www.unibas.it), Italy, at the [Department of Engineering](https://ingegneria.unibas.it/site/home.html). I am also the founder of eXtended Reality & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where I lead a research group dedicated to advancing the frontiers of XR and AI technologies. 

I got my Laurea in Informatica cum laude in 2001 from the [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it) and my PhD in Computer Science from the same University in 2004.

Research Summary
======
My research focuses on the intersection of Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, Human-Centered Computing, and Visualization. I am passionate about advancing Computer Graphics to create more immersive and realistic visual experiences. By integrating Artificial Intelligence, I develop intelligent systems that can understand, interpret, and generate complex visual data. My emphasis on Human-Centered Computing ensures that the technologies and applications I create are designed with the user's needs and experiences at the forefront. Through innovative Visualization techniques, I strive to make complex information more accessible and understandable, empowering users across various fields to make informed decisions.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively collaborate with industry partners to apply cutting-edge research to real-world challenges. This dual engagement allows me to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications, driving innovation in academia and industry.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
