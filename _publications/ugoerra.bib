VENNFS allows users to place documents and categories on a plane so that files may belong to multiple categories at once, where proximity on the plane can represent similarity and time filtering is allowed.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we estimate the effectiveness of exploiting coherence in Parallel Ray Tracing. We present a load-balancing technique which divides the original rendering problem in balanced subtasks and distribute them to independent processors through a Prediction Binary Tree (PBT). Furthermore the PBT allows to exploit temporal coherence among successive image frames. At each new frame, it updates the current PBT using a cost function which uses the previous rendering time as cost estimate. We also provide two heuristics which take advantage of data-locality. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution by running two experiments. The first one aims to investigate the accurancy of predictions made using the PBT. Results show that such predictions are quite accurate even considering a heavily unbalanced scene and a fast moving camera. The second experiment evaluates the two locality-aware heuristics showing a modest improvement.},

{Interactive ray tracing has seen enormous progress in recent years. However, advanced rendering techniques
requiring many million rays per second are still not feasible at interactive speed, and are only possible by means
of highly parallel ray tracing. When using compute clusters, good load balancing is crucial in order to fully
exploit the available computational power, and to not suffer from the overhead involved by synchronization
barriers. In this paper, we present a novel GPU method to compute a cost map: a per-pixel cost estimate of
the ray tracing rendering process. We show that the cost map is a powerful tool to improve load balancing in
parallel ray tracing, and it can be used for adaptive task partitioning and enhanced dynamic load balancing. Its
effectiveness has been proven in a parallel ray tracer implementation tailored for a cluster of workstations.}

We provide a scalable and flexible architecture for development and management of the client, server, and data that are used by the applications. The idea is based on the concept of a layer that contains information related to the real environment that is displayed by the device. Information that enhances reality is identified as points of interest by their geographic coordinates. Layers can also be organized in a hierarchical model as a tree-like structure. We present four case studies that demonstrate the flexibility and generalizability of our framework: management of electrical power line failures, support for hydrogeological monitoring, management of sensor networks, and geo-localization of tourist attractions.",

abstract="Virtual Reality potentialities can be exploited for several types of contexts beyond the mainstream video game industry. One of the most interesting application fields concerns its use in education and teaching especially in the contexts where security and safety are essential elements. The measurement of river flow is required for river management purposes including water resources planning, pollution prevention, and, flood control. The teaching of this complex task requires to transfer well-known methodologies as well as careful attention while performing the training in situ. In this paper, we propose a virtual reality tool called StreamFlowVR to improve the learning process for the river flow instruments and measuring methodologies. The basic idea is to create a rich user experience in a secure environment where students can understand the correct methodologies. We believe that the use of virtual reality benefits the students in learning hydraulic phenomenon faster and more confident respect to the traditional approach on a real river.",

abstract = "Background: Researchers have been exploring 3D representations for visualizing software. Among these representations, one of the most popular is the city metaphor, which represents a target object-oriented system as a virtual city. Recently, this metaphor has been also implemented in interactive software visualization tools that use virtual reality in an immersive 3D environment medium. Aims: We assessed the city metaphor displayed on a standard computer screen and in an immersive virtual reality with respect to the support provided in the comprehension of Java software systems. Method: We conducted a controlled experiment where we asked the participants to fulfill program comprehension tasks with the support of (i) an integrated development environment (Eclipse) with a plugin for gathering code metrics and identifying bad smells; and (ii) a visualization tool of the city metaphor displayed on a standard computer screen and in an immersive virtual reality. Results: The use of the city metaphor displayed on a standard computer screen and in an immersive virtual reality significantly improved the correctness of the solutions to program comprehension tasks with respect to Eclipse. Moreover, when carrying out these tasks, the participants using the city metaphor displayed in an immersive virtual reality were significantly faster than those visualizing with the city metaphor on a standard computer screen. Conclusions: Virtual reality is a viable means for software visualization."

Our method uses a convolutional neural network trained on a set of pairs of photographs acquired in an ad-hoc acquisition campaign. Each pair consists of one photograph of a subject’s face taken with the camera flash enabled and another one of the same subject in the same pose illuminated using a photographic studio-lighting setup. We show how our method can amend defects introduced by a close-up camera flash, such as specular highlights, shadows, skin shine, and flattened images."

abstract={Advanced intelligent surveillance systems are able to automatically analyze video of surveillance data without human intervention. These systems allow high accuracy of human activity recognition and then a high-level activity evaluation. To provide such features, an intelligent surveillance system requires a background subtraction scheme for human segmentation that captures a sequence of images containing moving humans from the reference background image. This paper proposes an alternative approach for human segmentation in videos through the use of a deep convolutional neural network. Two specific datasets were created to train our network, using the shapes of 35 different moving actors arranged on background images related to the area where the camera is located, allowing the network to take advantage of the entire site chosen for video surveillance. To assess the proposed approach, we compare our results with an Adobe Photoshop tool called Select Subject, the conditional generative adversarial network Pix2Pix, and the fully-convolutional model for real-time instance segmentation Yolact. The results show that the main benefit of our method is the possibility to automatically recognize and segment people in videos without constraints on camera and people movements in the scene (Video, code and datasets are available at http://graphics.unibas.it/www/HumanSegmentation/index.md.html).},
