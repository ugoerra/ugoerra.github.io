Objectives and learning outcomes
======
The course's main objective is to provide a theoretical and applicative introduction to 3D graphics with particular reference to approaches based on photorealistic offline renderings.

• Knowledge and understanding: The student must demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the mathematical models and algorithms that use Ray Tracing to generate photorealistic images, including the camera model, transformation matrices, lighting and shading models, texture mapping, global illumination, and implementation through the C/C++ language of all the theory illustrated in the lesson.

• Ability to apply knowledge and understanding: The student must demonstrate that he or she can modify and develop algorithms autonomously from the theory illustrated in the lesson, develop procedures capable of generating images from the scene description, and add and modify the approaches seen in the lesson to expand the possibilities of a photorealistic rendering system.

• Autonomy of judgment: the student must be able to independently evaluate a photorealistic rendering algorithm's fundamental properties and performance.

• Communication skills: The student must be able to present, using, if necessary, a language that can be understood even by non-experts, the functions of a photorealistic rendering system starting from its own, as well as the aspects of efficiency and effectiveness.

• Learning ability: The student must be able to consult texts autonomously and scientific articles on graphics rendering to extend the basic knowledge acquired during the course. For those interested in the Advanced Three-dimensional Graphics course, this applies to other application domains, such as real-time computer graphics.
